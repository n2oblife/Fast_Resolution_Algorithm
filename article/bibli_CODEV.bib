	abstract = {Electromagnetic analysis of superconducting integrated circuits is routinely required for inductance extraction. FastHenry is a well-known, applicable magnetoquasistatic analysis tool. It is accelerated with the multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA). A multilevel adaptive cross approximation solver with singular value decomposition recompression (MLACA-SVD) was recently proposed for FastHenry, as an alternative to the MLFMA. It was found to be more efﬁcient, with regards to accuracy versus required memory. It uses the same octree grouping as FastHenry’s MLFMA. Here, two modiﬁed grouping strategies are proposed to further improve MLACA-SVD efﬁciency by compressing interactions between larger groups, while maintaining scaling performance consistent with valid admissibility of interactions. The strategies are denoted “shell merging” and “wall merging.” Results show that the MLACA-SVD solver with merging requires about four times less memory than FastHenry’s MLFMA, for similar accuracy. Shell merging is found to be slightly superior.},

The improvement consists of a kind of normalization and a new stopping criterion for the ACA. By using the proposed method, we can avoid the trouble that ranks of approximated matrices increase rapidly as the matrix size increases when the conventional H-matrices with ACA are employed to an integral equation whose kernel function has high-order singularities. In particular, application of the proposed method enables us to perform large-scale simulations such that the conventional H-matrices with ACA fail to construct the low-rank approximation. Applicability of the proposed method is conﬁrmed through numerical experiments on an earthquake cycle simulation.},

	abstract = {Low-rank approximation methods, such as hierarchical (H) matrices and block low-rank (BLR) matrices, can approximate dense matrices that come from scientific integral equations to reduce computational costs and memory usage. When considering the efficient use of a massive number of MPI processes on distributed-memory systems, we must balance the computational load and construct an efficient communication pattern among MPI processors. Unfortunately, the complicated structure of H-matrices prevents us from meeting these requirements. Simplifying the matrix structure is one possible approach to solve this problem, and the lattice structures found in BLR-matrices are one of the most convenient structures for this approach. However, as a trade-off, the memory usage increases from H-matrices, which use O(N log N), to BLRmatrices, which use O(N{\textasciicircum}1.5). In this study, we propose a new method called “lattice H-matrices.” In short, the lattice Hmatrices are constructed by utilising H-matrices as submatrices in blocks of lattice structures observed in BLR-matrices. By assigning the lattice blocks to MPI processes, we can utilise sophisticated existing parallel algorithms for dense matrices. We demonstrate how the lattice block size should be defined and confirm that the memory complexity of the lattice H-matrices remains O(N log N) when using appropriate block sizes depending on the number of MPI processors. Accordingly, the lattice H-matrices maintain the advantages of both H-matrices and BLR-matrices. We examine the efficiency of lattice Hmatrices in arithmetic functions, such as H-matrix generation and H-matrix-vector multiplication, in large-scale problems on distributed-memory systems. In numerical experiments of electric field analyses, we confirmed that a relatively good load balance is maintained in the case of lattice H-matrices even if we use a large number of processes. The implementation of the lattice H-matrices exhibits a parallel speed-up that reaches as high as about 4,000 MPI processes. It is confirmed that the implementation of lattice H-matrix version is significantly faster than of normal H-matrix version for a large number of processes.},

	abstract = {Inductance extraction for superconducting integrated circuits requires the accurate solution of structural current distributions. FastHenry is a well known, magnetoquasistatic solver suitable for this task. It is based upon the partial element equivalent circuit, integral equation method, with the structure discretized into hexahedral ﬁlaments. It employs the multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA) for compressed storage of the mutual inductance matrix, which accounts for most of the required memory. This MLFMA implementation is especially memory efﬁcient, given certain approximations and algorithmic parameter choices. However, errors are introduced into the matrix representation. Here, a multilevel adaptive cross approximation solver with singular value decomposition recompression (MLACA-SVD) is presented as an alternative to FastHenry’s existing MLFMA solver. MLACA-SVD compresses off-diagonal matrix blocks to a speciﬁed error tolerance, based on evaluating selected entries. Quadrature recipes are presented for guaranteed accuracy of matrix entry evaluation. Numerical results for examples of practical interest show that the MLACA-SVD memory scaling versus b (number of ﬁlaments) is practically identical to that of FastHenry’s MLFMA, and is close to O(b log b). The MLACA-SVD requires less memory for the same solution accuracy, and furthermore offers complete control over matrix approximation errors. For the examples considered, it is found to be a more efﬁcient solver. It is well suited to parallelization.},

Although the ﬂat-MPI version gives better parallel scalability when constructing hierarchical matrices, the speed-up reaches a limit in the hierarchical matrix-vector multiplication.

The main qualities of ACA are maintained: it is purely algebraic and independent of the integral equation kernel Green’s function as long as it produces pseudo-rank-deﬁcient matrix blocks.

	abstract = {This paper presents the adaptive cross approximation (ACA) algorithm to reduce memory and CPU time overhead in the method of moments (MoM) solution of surface integral equations. The present algorithm is purely algebraic; hence, its formulation and implementation are integral equation kernel (Green’s function) independent. The algorithm starts with a multilevel partitioning of the computational domain. The interactions of well-separated partitioning clusters are accounted through a rankrevealing LU decomposition. The acceleration and memory savings of ACA come from the partial assembly of the rank-deﬁcient interaction submatrices. It has been demonstrated that the ACA algorithm results in O(N logN ) complexity (where N is the number of unknowns) when applied to static and electrically small electromagnetic problems. In this paper the ACA algorithm is extended to electromagnetic compatibility-related problems of moderate electrical size. Speciﬁcally, the ACA algorithm is used to study compact-range ground planes and electromagnetic interference and shielding in vehicles. Through numerical experiments, it is concluded that for moderate electrical size problems the memory and CPU time requirements for the ACA algorithm scale as N 4/3logN .},
